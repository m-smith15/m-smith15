## <div align="center">But seriously... </div>
 <p align="center">Hello and welcome! My name is Mack. This profile will serve as a diary of my journey into the coding world. <br/><br/>
 To start this journey, I enrolled and completed a coding bootcamp through Coding Dojo learning Python, Java, and MERN. The assignments I've completed in regards to the bootcamp are a little further in, feel free to check them out. <br><br>
Lots of coding bootcamps out there, if you'd like to know more about the one I attended you can check out more details on their <a href="https://www.codingdojo.com/online-coding-bootcamp-full-time">website</a>. <p>

## <div align="center"> What have I been up to... </div>
<p align="center">While attending Coding Dojo's coding bootcamp, we were encouraged to undertake some personal projects. You're more than welcome to check out my <a href="https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects">Projects</a> repo. If unsure, let me suggest:</p>
<p align="center">(Python) <a href="https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects/tree/master/Python/wow_ah_project">Offline Auction House</a> - this was my passion project. It is an application that consumes Blizzard's Auction house API and returns results based off of a users query. This lets me (and other users) explore, interact, and enjoy the world more - instead of sitting infront of the auction house manually inputting data into spreadsheets! This full-stack application is deployed with Vercel using a PlanetScale cloud SQL db and is can be accessed at <a href="https://projects-phi-nine.vercel.app/">this URL</a>
</p>
<p align="center">(Java) <a href="https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects/tree/master/Java">Character Template</a> - This was a 2-part project that involved building a web scraper that scraped a Wiki's tables for data to build (and quickly re-build) out a database of spells and abilities. The other half of the application utilizes that database to display spells and abilities based on levels input. The idea behind this was to allow for further theorycrafting of potential characters as my friends and I continue playing together. 
</p>
<p align="center">(MERN) <a href="https://github.com/m-smith15/webdev_flashcards">Webdev Flashcards</a> - I know enough to know that I don't know...yet! The purpose of this full application is to to help users brush up on their knowledge of development terms, concepts, and acronyms.  This full-stack application is deployed with Vercel and is can be accessed at <a href="https://webdev-flashcards.vercel.app/">this URL</a>.
</p>
  
## <div align="center"> Coding Bootcamp </div>
<p align="center">While enrolled in Coding Dojo's coding bootcamp, I earned the coveted "black belt" in each of my stacks - demonstrating a strong understanding and mastery of the technology. To earn a black belt, students would have to implement difficult and advanced features into their projects like M:M relationships, advanced validations, or additional tables with specific interaction requirements. This was on top of creating a fully CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) application in under 5 hours. Check out the code over in my <a href="https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects/tree/master/belt_exams">belt_exams</a> repo, or I've got the TL;DR below:</p>
<p>ðŸ’¸These applications have been taking offline to avoid mounting AWS charges, but reach out if you'd like to see them spun up! </p>
<p align="center">Python: <a href="https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects/tree/master/belt_exams/python/magazine">Magazine Subscription App</a>. <!-- Check it out: http://3.23.104.32/. Create a new user, or use shrimp@ocean.com | shrimp --> </p>
<p align="center">Java: <a href="https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects/tree/master/belt_exams/Java/Yoga">Yoga Instructor App</a>.  <!--  Check it out: http://18.223.23.14/. Create a new user, or use shrimp@ocean.com | shrimp -->  </p>
<p align="center">MERN: <a href="https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects/tree/master/belt_exams/MERN/pirate_life">Pirate crew builder</a>.  <!-- Check it out: http://18.221.71.54/. Create, Update, Read, or Destory pirate's - all on a SPA! --> </p>
