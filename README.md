### :tada: Good news everyone!
#### The new test subjects have arrived! 

### But seriously...
 - Hello and welcome! My name is Mack. I'm fresh to the coding world, and boy howdy am I excited to be here now.
 - I've enrolled in a coding bootcamp through Coding Dojo. You'll find all my work done a litle further in.
   - My personal projects are in the "Projects" repo though!
 
### A little about me...
 - Personality Type: INTJ
 - I'm goal oriented, and driven by understanding the why behind anything
 - I enjoy challenges, and the struggle they provide.
 
#### I wish...
 - I would look back and appreciate the obstacles I've overcome more
 - Someone would have told me how much fun coding is sooner!
 - I could remember what 42 was the answer to...
