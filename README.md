The new users have arrived! 

### But seriously...
 - Hello and welcome! My name is Mack. I'm fresh to the coding world, and boy howdy am I excited to be here now.
 - I've enrolled in a coding bootcamp through Coding Dojo. You'll find all my work done a little further in.
   - Personally, I reccomend checking out the [Offline Auction House](https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects/tree/master/Python/wow_ah_project) or my Web scraping Java project [Character Template](https://github.com/m-smith15/Projects/tree/master/Java)
 
### A little about me...
 - My personality type is [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality)
   * [What's yours?](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test)
 - I'm goal oriented, and driven by understanding the why behind anything
 - As someone who is competitive, I enjoy challenges and the struggle they provide
 - I am a huge fantasy nerd, and a self-proclaimed history buff

 * Favorite histoical event
 * Horde or Alliance | Classic or Retail (or both!)
 * Light or Dark side of the Force
 * Imperium, Chaos, or do you enjoy screaming "WAAAGH"
